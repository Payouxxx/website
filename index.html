          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p style="text-align: left;">
            Did you know that former President Barack Obama was the first president ever to brew a beer in the White House ? 
            Beer is deeply ingrained in American culture, the US are ranked 15th in beer consumption per capita.
            With the booming craft beer industry, there are now tens of thousands of local breweries throughout the country producing interesting, unique and flavorful beers. 
            With beer reviews, you can learn about the history and backstory of each brewery, as well as the various beers they offer and their flavor profiles. 
            By reading reviews, you can discover which beers are best suited to your particular tastes and which local breweries are worth a visit.
            <br></br>
            There is reason to believe that investigating beer reviews will allow us to understand if American people are more likely to give better grades to local beers. 
            We will also investigate if political tendecies impact beer liking. Our analysis will rely on almost 10 million reviews from 
            worldwide reviews site that we will introduce you in the next section. 
            <br></br>

                <h3>Reviews in the States</h3>
                Taking a closer look to the dataset we observe that there is a total of 5277 breweries. However they do not seem to be the largest ones in the US.
                The 2nd largest brewery in the US in 2021 was <a href="https://www.brewersassociation.org/press-releases/brewers-association-releases-annual-craft-brewing-industry-production-report-and-top-50-producing-craft-brewing-companies-for-2021/" target="_blank">MolsonCoors</a> for instance and  
                we observe that only <b>0.26%</b> of the reviews are made from beers coming out of their breweries. It seems that the dataset gathers more reviews about craft brewed beers 
                and wonâ€™t necessarily be representative of all beer drinkers. It's always important to know the bias you are working with.

      <div class="container" data-aos="fade-up">

        <div class="section-title">
          <h2>Where do the reviews come from?</h2>
          <p style="text-align: left;">
            To understand better the data we are working with, we will first introduce you to the data sources. The reviews come from two different 
            websites : <a href="https://www.beeradvocate.com/" target="_blank">Beer Advocate</a> and 
            <a href="https://www.ratebeer.com/" target="_blank">Rate Beer</a> which are the two biggest beer review websites in the world. 
            <br></br> 
            BeerAdvocate and RateBeer provide valuable insights into the world of beer reviews. 
            The datasets contain data on beer ratings, reviews, and other information about beer from users of the sites. 
            This includes information about the type of beer, its style, its region of origin, its ABV, and its ratings from users. 
            Additionally, the datasets also contain information about the user who wrote the review, such as their location, age, and gender.
            The will alow us to analyse how beer reviews influence the perception of a beer. For example, a comparison of ratings and reviews of a particular beer can be used to determine whether users in different regions have different opinions about the same beer.
            Additionally, the datasets can be used to examine how factors such as age, gender, and location affect user opinion.
            Information can be drawn to determine the different types of beers popular in different regions. 
              
            </p>
        </div>
        <div style="text-align: left;margin-bottom: 1em;"> 
          <h3>Pre-processing</h3>
          For both datasets, we added two columns that corresponds to the country of the user and the country of the brewery. The geographical information contain the name of the country for users and breweries. 
          However, for the US based locations, we also have the name of the state. We want to extract this information and add it to the dataframe. To do so we create an extra column for both breweries and users 
          that will contain the US postal abbreviations for each state. We then finished processing the locations by dropping the state name in the location column. By quickly giving a look at the repartition
          of the users location. Some US territories have 1 review each. We therefore removed them from the dataframe since they will not be useful for our analysis.
          We end up with 2 dataframes named <code>BA_US</code> and <code>RB_US</code>. 
          We also converted the <b rating></b> column to a <code>datetime object</code>.
          <br></br> 
          After our processing, we wanted to know the proportion of <code>NaN</code> values for the <b rating></b> and <b text></b> columns in the dataframes.
          If we look at how much these <code>NaN</code> values are represented in the dataframes, we can see that for <code>RB_US</code> the <code>NaN</code> 
          values represent 0.005% of the data and for <code>BA_US</code> they represent 0.6% of the data. Thus we can drop these rows without losing too much information.
          As our story concerns US reviews, we decided to get rid of the reviews made by users not living in the US. 
          <br></br> 
          Comes the time to merge the dataframes. We needed to normalize the data because the distributions are different between the two websites. 
          By following the same procedure as in <a href="https://dlab.epfl.ch/people/west/pub/Lederrey-West_WWW-18.pdf" target="_blank">Lederrey-West paper</a>, thus assuming <quote>that the inherent quality of beers being rated stays roughly constant</quote>,
          we performed a z-score normalization of the ratings. Then merging <code>BA_US</code> and <code>RB_US</code> dataframes using the <code>concat()</code> of <code>pandas</code> is trivial. 
          From now on we have a dataframe called <code>df_ratings</code> to work with.

          Comparing the number of reviews made by users from one state, to the number of reviews made about beers from that state, we can see that within the top 10
          of both distributions we find the states of California, Washington, Pensilvania, New York and Massachusetts. Some of them are not surprising as
          they are the states with the highest population. Nonethless, these are valuable insights strenghtening our research question about a possible link between the

          <h2>Sentiment analysis</h2>
          <p style="text-align: left;">
            Sentiment analysis is a method using Natural Language Processing, text analysis and other algorithms to identify, extract, quantify and 
            study the polarity of subjective information in a given text (e.g. a positive or negative opinion). Performing a Sentiment analysis 
            on beer reviews will allow us to see if the reviews tend to be positive or negative. We will use the TextBlob library that uses a natural language toolkit (NLTK). 
            It uses NLTK because it is simple, easy to deploy, will use up fewer resources, gives dependency parsing, and can be used even for small applications.
            When a sentence is passed into Textblob it gives two outputs, which are polarity and subjectivity. Polarity is the output that lies between [-1,1], where -1 refers to 
            negative sentiment and +1 refers to positive sentiment. Subjectivity is the output that lies within [0,1] and refers to personal opinions and judgments.
          </p>

          <div style="text-align: center; width: 80%; margin: auto; margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 3em;">
            <i class="bx bxs-quote-alt-left quote-icon-left"></i>
              This too is a great beer! Around Christmas time they release a 3 Litre Bottle! Once bottle is finished you can still bring it into any Stone Brewery and get it refilled!
            <i class="bx bxs-quote-alt-right quote-icon-right"></i>
          </div>

          <div style="text-align: left;">
            This particular review had a sentiment score of: <b>1.0</b>. 
            This is expected as they used the words "great" and "Christmas" which are often used as positive words.
            Also the use of "!" shows that the reviewer is excited about the beer. We can also notice that the quantity
            of the beer is mentioned in a positive way, as the reviewer is excited about the fact that they can get the beer refilled.
            Comparing with the garde they gave to the beer, it shows consistancy as the rating is of 5 stars. 
            Let's investigate the relation between the sentiment score and the rating, to see if there is a correlation.
          </div>

          <div class="row" style="margin-top: 0em;">
            <div class="col-lg-1"></div>

                <iframe width="800" height= "500" src="figures/boxplot_sentiment_rating.html"></iframe>

            </div>
          </div>  
          <div style="text-align: left;margin-bottom: 1em;">
            In this figure, we observe that the distributions of sentiment scores are concentrated around the median, the maximum and the minimum
            are quite close to the median. However, rating scores are more spread across the median, with outliers on both sides. From observational analysis only we 
            can not conclude that there is a correlation between the sentiment score and the rating. We will use a regression analysis to see if there is a correlation as well as 
            statistical tests such as Pearson's correlation coefficient and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient.
          </div>

          <div style="text-align: left;margin-bottom: 1em;"> 
            <h3>Linear Regression</h3>
            For this linear regression we decided to plot the sentiment score, calculated previously, against the rating. We used the statsmodels library to perform the regression analysis.
            The results of the regression analysis are shown below for 6 different beers having at leat 1500 reviews (an arbitrary number chosen as the minimum significant number of reviews). 
            <div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 2em;font-size: large;"> 
              <p>Sentiment score vs Rating</p>
            </div>
              <div style="margin: 0;margin-top: -1.5em;margin-bottom: -1em"> 
                <div class="row">
                  <div class="col-lg-6">
                    <iframe width="700" height="700"src="figures/regression_1.html"></iframe>

                  </div>
                </div>
              </div>
            The R-squared values are really low, which means that the sentiment score does not explain the variation in the rating.  
          </div>
          <div style="text-align: left;margin-bottom: 1em;"> 
            <h3>statistical tests</h3>
            <div style="text-align: left; margin-top: 2em;font-size: large;"> 
              Using the <code>pearsonr</code> function from the <code>scipy.stats</code> library, we can calculate the Pearson's correlation coefficient and the p-value
              for the sentiment score and the rating. 
              <br></br>
              <b>p-value</b> <span id="tab">0.000000</span><br>
              <b>Pearson's coefficient</b> <span id="tab">0.352315</span><br>
              <br></br>
              The p-value is very low, meaning that there is a correlation between the sentiment score and the rating. Which is nuanced
              by the Pearson's coefficient which positive and close to 0.35, therefore the correlation is moderate. The Pearson's correlation test
              assumes that the data is normally distributed, which is not the case here, and a linear relationship betweem the variables. 
              <br></br>
              The assumptions of the Spearman correlation are that data must be ordinal (we can tell without doubt if a value is lower or higher than another).
              We are testing if the data are monotically related (the size of one variable increases as the other variables also increases, 
              or where the size of one variable increases as the other variable also decreases).
              <br></br>
              <b>Spearman's coefficient</b> <span id="tab">0.334857</span><br>
              <br></br>
              We obtained a Spearman coefficient of 0.33, which is close to the Pearson's coefficient. 
              It represents a medium association between the sentiment score and the rating. A positive coefficient indicates that as the rating increases,
              the sentiment score also increases, even if it's a moderate effect.

        <div class="section-title">
          <h2>Beer Aspects</h2>
          <p style="text-align: left;">
            Reviewers are asked to fill in 5 different grades : 'Aroma', 'Taste', 'Palate', 'Appearance' and 'Overall'. A rating is then done by doing the weighted average 
            of these 5 aspects. In this section we investigate which aspect in 'Aroma', 'Taste', 'Palate' and â€˜Appearance' are the most important for the overall score.               This will give us insights on what aspect reviewers tend to prefer in beers.
            To do so we will use 2 different methods to be able to cross check our findings. The first method is a PCA or Principal Component Analysis, the second method is a multi-linear regression. 
              
          <div style="text-align: left;margin-bottom: 1em;"> 
            <h3>Princpal Component Analysis</h3>
            For the PCA, we will use the 4 different aspects as features and â€˜overallâ€™ as the target. We use the PCA function from sklearn.decomposition 
            library with 2 components. After fitting the features the to the PCA we extract the explained variance ratios this gives us the following vector : <b>[0.73276579, 0.12129502]</b>
            This means the first principal component explains <b>73.3%</b> of the variance and the second <b>12.1%</b>. We finish our PCA analysis by plotting the principal components 1 and 2. 
              <div class="col-lg-6" style="width: 60%; margin: auto;">
                <img src="figures/PCA.png" class="img-fluid" alt="">
              </div>
            It seems taste is the most important aspect and appearance the least important. There is almost no difference between aroma and palate thus we cannot conclude 
            much on which one of the two are more important.
          </div>

          <div style="text-align: left;"> 
            <h3>Multilinear Regression</h3>
            We perform a multilinear regression using the sklearnâ€™s LinearRegression function. We apply fit the data to the regression and in order to evaluate the quality of 
            our regression we calculate the coefficient of determination : 0.75, this is considered a good value. Thus, our model should be correct. We now simply get the coefficient of the 
            regression and print the weights we obtain : <b>[0.04819957 0.14019966 0.58786571 0.17108195]</b>
            These correspond respectively to 'appearance','aroma','taste' and 'palate'. As expected the most important is taste and then followed by palate and aroma and behind is the appearance. 
            Due to the close weights of palate and aroma, it is hazardous to state that one is more important than the other. In order to push this a little further, we computed a heat map of the correlation between the different variables.
              <div class="col-lg-6" style="width: 60%; margin: auto;">
                <iframe width="600" height="515"src="figures/corr_matrix.html"></iframe>
              </div>
            As we can see, taste is still the most important and appearance the least however aroma and palate have very similar scores with aroma a bit ahead this time. With this in mind, 
            the only conclusion we can bring out is the fact that taste is most important and appearance the least important.

          <h2>Impact regression</h2>
          <p style="text-align: left;">
            The aim of this part is to perform a linear regression on the change of stock to . Indeed, a simple linear regression was 
            calculated to describe the change of stock at a given day based on the market cap, the money volume, whether or not 
            Elon Musk has talked about the company, and especially the sentiment analysis of the quote.  
            We want to investigate the degree to which the variable sentiment score predicts the change of stock price.
            <br><br>

            To do so, we continue to use the data frame of the observational study but we need to make some modifications. 
            In the beginning, we add a column of sentiment score for each quote, and for the companies not quoted we set the 
            score to 0. Afterward, we noticed that there are many quotes on the same day, some of them are different quotes and 
            some of them are the same as the first one. In this case, we add all the different quotes that occur on the same day. 
            Therefore, on the same day, it can happen that there are different rows of the same company with different sentiment 
            scores.
            <br><br>

            We also add a column that describes the change of the stock: we take the mean of the change of the stock during 
            the three days following the day of the quote.
            <br><br>

            Now that all the data is gathered the linear regression can be performed:
          </p>

          <br><br>
          
          <div class="col-lg-12">

          </div>

          <p style="text-align: left;">
            <br><br>
            Where x1, x2, x3,x4, x5 represent respectively the MarketCap, Popularity, Money Volume, sentiment analysis score of 
            the quote, and whether Elon talked about the company. The method used here is Ordinary Least Squares (OLS). 
            As you can see the estimation of the coefficients of the sentiment score and the Elon variable are very 
            low. The coefficients represent the rate of change of the stock price with respect to the variables. 
            This means Elon quotes still don't have an impact on the change of stock price, even when we expanded the model.

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p style="text-align: left;">
            In light of the above, we did not see that Elon had a significant impact on the stock prices. In fact, we conducted two analyses to check if Elon's quotes have an impact on the stock prices by constructing an observational study  and to represent the impact of the quotes on the change of the stock price, by performing a linear regression. 
            <br><br>
            As stated in our research questions we wanted to test if his impact (if he had any) was different for big and small companies. However, the quotes about smaller companies are not enough to make an analysis of his impact on them.  One can think before this study that his impact would be significant on larger companies, except maybe Tesla, where he has an important role and therefore probably a direct impact. Interestingly enough, Tesla is also the company that had the most significant result in the Mann-Whitley U test. One can also take into consideration that Elon Musk usually uses Twitter when he utters an opinion about different companies. Unfortunately, Quote Bank does not take into account the tweets, as said at the beginning. 
            <br><br>
            However, the following study proves that when taking the covariates that we defined, Elon quotes don't have an impact on the stock price regardless of the sentiment score of the quote.

          <h2>Future work</h2>
          <p style="text-align: left;">
            There were things that we were not able to do, due to time limits as well as other reasons, such as some limitations with Quotebank. But there are still a lot of interesting things that we could have looked at. We will list some of the stuff we think that could be interesting to look at in the future.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p style="text-align: left;">
            For the observational study, we could have added more covariates, or taken a larger set of controlled companies to have a better matching. But as noticed, the propensity scores are not very similar for the matched companies. One can think of improving the propensity score model to have a more accurate score. There is also a large data missing or not available, for example, we tried to match Tesla with Rivian for example, but like for a lot of other companies they were either private or only had too recent stock prices.
          </p>

          <br>
          <p style="text-align: left;">
            We were not able to get historical prices for cryptocurrencies which was very unfortunate for the data story. 
            Therefore we was not able to look at Elon's effect on cryptocurrencies.
            We tried to use <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/api/documentation/v1/" target="_blank">CoinMarketcap's API</a>, 
            the most popular API for cryptocurrency, but unfortunately we needed a paid subscriptions in order to obtain the historical data. 
            The error message stated this: <i>"Your API Key subscription plan doesn't support " 'this endpoint.'</i>
          </p>
          <br>
          <p style="text-align: left;">
            As we briefly mentioned earlier, we were unfortunately not able to look at if Musk had a bigger impact on smaller companies compared to big companies, so-called large-cap companies, due to the fact that Quotebank did not contain quotes about smaller companies.  
          </p>
          <br>
          <p style="text-align: left;">
            We also wanted to look at if Elon's impact changed over the years. However, we did not have time to look into that.
          </p>
